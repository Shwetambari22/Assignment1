Solution

1. Clone the inventory repo @ https://github.com/Shwetambari22/Assignment1.git
2. Import maven project "inventory"
3. MySQL DB is used. To set up the schema, run scripts in folder "db_scripts_inventory"
4. In application.properties set root_path = local directory path
5. Run the app
6. It can be tested via postman
7. The endpoints available are:
  GET
  
  http://localhost:8081/api/employee/{id}
  
  http://localhost:8081/api/employee/all
  
  http://localhost:8081/api/employee/uploadstatus/{taskid}
  
  POST
  
  http://localhost:8081/api/employee

  {
    "firstName": "JACK",
    "lastName": "SMITH",
    "age": 45
  }
